### 💰 F. Revenue Potential (Neutral & Safe)

Conservative model:

- ₹1,00,000 per office/year

- 4,000 municipalities → ₹400 crore

- 4,000 constituencies → ₹400 crore

- Even 1% of this → Unicorn-scale opportunity.

> **Unicorn-scale opportunity - a startup valued at $1 billion+**

### Practcally

👉 The total potential market is so huge that
even if our product captures just 1% of it,
the company’s valuation and revenue can grow to the level of a unicorn (a startup valued at $1 billion+).

In simple words:

The market is massive.

You don’t need 50% or 20% or even 5% of it.

Just 1% is enough to make the company extremely big and highly valuable.

> Example:
> If the total market is ₹50,000 crore,
> **1% of it = ₹500 crore business.**

- Even 1% of this → Unicorn-scale opportunity.
